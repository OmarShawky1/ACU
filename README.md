## Summary

Active Courses University is a community targeting to work in Big N. Similar to the [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) community, it provides educational resources. Additionally, ACU provides professional Career, Networking, and Academic Advisory services.

Similar to real universities, services are provided mostly by peers/students, and some by professionals (> 3 YoE). ACU members are all authentic members providing Services (Career Services, Academic Advisory, and much more in [Services Onboarding](#services-onboarding)).

For a full comparison between ACU and other servers, online communities, paid boot camps and real universities, Check [ACU Comparison](./README-Explanation.md#acu-comparison).

ACU Resources consist of three primary resources (OSSU, CS Fundamentals, and Big N SE Roadmaps) utilizing suggestions from Pioneer Software Engineers and other reliable sources. Further information is in [Resources](#resources).

If you like the idea, share it. You will benefit directly & indirectly. Your tutor, coach, mentor, or study buddy might be the colleague you invited or invited by him. Try to share it on your Twitter, Facebook, or class group, or ask someone famous to share it.

#### Sub-Fields

To be done...

### Essential

* Before diving into the following resources, you can first check "What they are about" from [Essential Explanation](./README-Explanation.md#essential).

1. Essential skills:
   1. How to ask questions?
      1. [Dr. Mostafa's advice on how to ask (Arabic)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxLOqb54omI).
      2. Watch [Coursera's "Getting Help" video](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/data-scientists-tools/getting-help-dhpW3).
      3. Read [Stack Overflow "How to ask"](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask).
      4. Read [FreeCodeCamp's "How to ask good questions" article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-ask-good-technical-questions/).
      5. Read about [XY Problem](https://mywiki.wooledge.org/XyProblem).
      6. Ask a binary question if possible. (I.e., True/false)
      7. If not, Ask the enclosed question if possible. (I.e., the question that has an expected answer; E.g., Which color? "Red", "Green", "Blue")
      8. If not, ask open questions and supply atomic information in an enumerated form. (E.g., "How to study Algorithms?" 1. I know math. 2. I know Programming Languages.)
      9. Note: Atomic information is the simplest form of information possible that can not be further broken down into even simpler data and can never hold more than a single meaning.
   2. Who to ask before you ask?
      1. Only reliable person that is in charge, or has been in charge, or reached the end of the road you want to take.
      2. Never rely on an answer/course even if it is free before performing rule 1 above.
      3. Arabic shorts & videos:
         1. Dr. Mostafa: Video [1](https://www.youtube.com/live/ZHMr5kPjFpk?feature=share) & [2](https://www.youtube.com/live/8pSt7yhkfSw?feature=share).
         2. Mr. Moshrif: Video [1](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1453088708370995).
   3. How to study and not forget what you studied? Use Obsidian (using Zettlekasten & Wikipedia styles)
   4. What is your opinion about X/Y/Z Course?
      1. Arabic:
         1. Mr. Moshrif: Video [1](https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?ref=watch_permalink&v=553205550240384) & [2](https://fb.watch/jKaKqf2Rjq/). [Post](https://www.facebook.com/mmoshrif/posts/pfbid02gNUwraX2rJdykh2c6XXeAqKBh3ucdo7YcLx5qeHRqm87NywW769VavTTmZ197Hmdl).
         2. Dr. Mostafa: Video [1](https://www.youtube.com/live/jJoVVCfDCN4).
   5. How do you plan and solve most of your problems (in life and the field or industry) smartly with the least thinking effort and minimize failures?
      1. Check "How to ask?" above.
      2. Check related records or background about who is giving you the advice. If he is advising on "How to work at Google?" he must have worked there at least.
      3. Avoid unaccountable advice or courses from unreliable people, even if they are free. Unless a person is accountable for what he says and has an active track record, treat every word with a grain of salt.
      4. For you to ask someone, you need to build a relationship with them. You also might need to show that you also help when you can, as this will increase the chances of getting help.
      5. Firmly believing that you are not exceptional by any means. 99.99% of your problems have faced others as well, and they developed a solution for them, but you just didn't research enough.
2. Essential tools: git-and-github (in [ACU-English channel](https://discord.com/channels/1026170883997438112/1026170885331222549) or [ACU-Arabic channel](https://discord.com/channels/950993900720492574/951580791316574248)) & Linux (in [ACU-English channel](https://discord.com/channels/1026170883997438112/1026170885331222550) or [ACU-Arabic channel](https://discord.com/channels/950993900720492574/951580813756088380)).

3. MENTORSHIP
   1. mentors-announcements: All mentors announcements.
4. *SPECIAL CATEGORY*: This is not the name of the category but some set of categories that have the following similar channels:
   1. *general*: Place for members to get answers from all *special roles* members.
   2. *side-channel*: Like "general" above but requires just one answer.
   3. knowledge-base: Stackoverflow-like for resources between members.
5. SOCIAL:  
   1. off-topic: For non-cs type of questions (E.g., ask for opinions, what is Gen-Ed?...).
6. GENERAL: Channels that do not fit anywhere else.
   1. recommended: Stackoverflow-like resources for @Students.

   3. general-questions: Topic-less Q&A.
   4. life-after-grad: Topic-less Q&A but for graduation year (E.g., graduation project) and beyond (E.g., resume review).
7. From CORE PROGRAMMING to CORE SYSTEMS: Categories ordered after OSSUs' curriculum. Contains *general* channel for each topic (in OSSUs' curriculum) and a specific channel for each course covering the same topic (E.g., general-dsa & princeton-algo-part1). You can study OSSUs' courses here or there in addition to ACU SE-oriented courses.
8. CS-SUB-FIELDS: For CS-minors.
   1. general-cs-subfields: For CS-minors that have low traffic.
   2. general-ai

       2. gsoc: General discussions about Google Summer of Code.
11. CAREER: For career-specific preparation topics. For general discussions (E.g., Offer negotiation), go to life-after-grad or *general* (for *specific roles*).
    1. ps-grinding: Accelerate studying problem-solving by studying for others to increase commitment level. Similar to mock interviews, except that each pair of people decides their terms (E.g., no camera, no voice communication...). In other words, it is half-mock-interviews.
    2. mock-interviews: Schedule mock-interviews between @Trusted only. Ask for a random mock or prepare before an interview (mock all day).
    3. internships: Share and discuss internship options, application process, and tips between @Students.
    4. vacancies: Applications resources. Each application has a link and useful information (Company, Job, recruiters and hiring managers) to further facilitate your application chances.
    5. mutual-apply: Apply together at the same time to the same vacancy.
12. ARCHIVE: Old channels replaced with way/channels of doing things or that does not have traffic anymore (E.g., gsoc is seasonal)
